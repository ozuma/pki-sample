# Abstract

Here is my memo & config files & scripts to create my own PKI enviroment. (e.g. MY Root CA, Issue my Certficate, ...etc.)

This repository inlude some private keys, and I KNOW IT IS DANGEROUS. I create this repository just for study and testing, so YOU DON'T NEED TO ALERT ME. I never use these keys in public server.
